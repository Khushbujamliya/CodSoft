Java Mini Projects – Java Internship at CodSoft

This repository contains a collection of Java console-based mini projects developed as part of my Java Development Internship at CodSoft. These beginner-to-intermediate level projects demonstrate my understanding of core Java concepts including object-oriented programming, control structures, file handling, and user input.

Technologies Used:
- Java (JDK 8+)
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- File I/O (CSV-based storage)
- Console-based user interaction

## Projects Included

###  1. Number Guessing Game
A fun and interactive game that:
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Asks the user to guess the number and provides feedback: "Too High", "Too Low", or "Correct".
- Limits the number of attempts.
- Supports multiple rounds with scoring based on attempts taken.

###  2. Student Grade Calculator
A simple academic tool that:
- Accepts marks for multiple subjects (out of 100).
- Calculates total marks, average percentage.
- Assigns a grade (A+, A, B+, etc.) based on performance.
- Displays a complete result summary for the student.

###  3. ATM Interface
A simulated ATM system with the following features:
- User login with PIN authentication.
- Check balance, deposit, and withdraw money.
- Multi-user support using file-based (CSV) data storage.
- New user registration from within the program.
- Account information saved to accounts.csv file.
- Automatically updates balances and preserves data between sessions.
 Note: The accounts.csv file is created only once and is updated only when accounts are added or modified.
